Git Template Global\SlickEdit
===

Use `git ignore add slickedit` to add this ignore template.

```
# SlickEdit workspace and project files are ignored by default because
# typically they are considered to be developer-specific and not part of a
# project.
*.vpw
*.vpj

# SlickEdit workspace history and tag files always contain user-specific
# data so they should not be stored in a repository.
*.vpwhistu
*.vpwhist
*.vtg
```
